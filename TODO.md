# TODO

In no particular order:

- [ ] Complete the content (doh)
- [ ] Make the base font size variable depending on viewport (currently only the meblem an paragraph text scales)
- [ ] Replace the hefty PNG background image with 2 (dark/light) WEBPs
- [ ] Add a cookie notification
- [ ] Remove the google fonts dependency / store the fonts locally
- [ ] Improve accessibility (aria-hidden on layout-only elements, change sections with no semantic meaning to divs etc.)
- [ ] Add `alt` to dark/light switch icons
- [ ] Force Tailwind to pre-build in development mode
